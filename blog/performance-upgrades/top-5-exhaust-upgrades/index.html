        <h1>Top 5 Exhaust Upgrades for Yamaha PW50</h1>
        <p>The Yamaha PW50 is a legendary starter bike, but its stock exhaust system is often restricted for initial
            safety. As your young rider grows in confidence and skill, upgrading the pipe is one of the most effective
            ways to shed weight and improve the power curve.</p>

        <h2>1. FMF Fatty Pipe</h2>
        <p>The FMF Fatty is the gold standard for PW50 performance. It widens and smooths out the power band while
            providing noticeable gains throughout the entire RPM range.</p>

        <h2>2. Pro Circuit Works Pipe</h2>
        <p>If you're looking for that "factory" look and feel, Pro Circuit delivers. Their Works Pipe offers excellent
            throttle response and a distinct racing sound that kids love.</p>

        <h2>3. DEP Expansion Chamber</h2>
        <p>DEP is known for its high-quality construction. Their expansion chamber for the PW50 is specifically designed
            to provide a more aggressive hit in the mid-range.</p>

        <h2>4. Dronesmiths Alpha Racing Exhaust</h2>
        <p>Our custom-engineered Alpha series focuses on durability and easy installation. It provides a balanced gain,
            making it perfect for both trail riding and local tracks.</p>

        <h2>5. Bill's Pipes Expansion Chamber</h2>
        <p>Bill's Pipes offers a classic two-stroke performance feel. It's a great choice for riders who want to
            maximize top-end speed on longer straightaways.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>Do I need to re-jet my PW50 after an exhaust upgrade?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, usually a slightly larger main jet is required to compensate for the increased airflow and
                    ensure the engine runs cool and efficiently.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>Will a louder exhaust make the bike faster?</strong></p>
                <p>Sound doesn't equate to speed, but performance exhausts are designed to optimize backpressure, which
                    improves engine efficiency and power output.</p>
